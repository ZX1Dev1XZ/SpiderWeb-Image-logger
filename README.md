 📣 Some notes
AFTER THE BUILD U CAN DELETE EVERYTHING IN THE OUTPUT DIRECTORY EXCEPT THE EXE FILE!
I created this project for educational purposes only, so please do not use it to harm and damage; I started this project because I wanted to learn about Discord's infrastructure and possible exploits. Meanwhile, I made the base of this token-grabber (like a year ago), but not long ago, I continued this project, and this is the final result; of course, I will update it and add more features in the future, but mean-while remember to use your power for good 😲. If you liked it, consider ⭐ this project and 🕵️ (follow) me 🤔.

⛔ What can I do against token grabbers?
To be protected against token grabbers, you are more than welcome to install my Anti-Token-Grabber, which is located on my GitHub. [I will upload it later; meanwhile, try https://github.com/andro2157/DiscordTokenProtector although this grabber is bypassing it, other grabbers are not]
